ES6 Classes
In JavaScript, you define a class using the class keyword. Here's how you can define a class, add methods to it, add a static method, and extend it from another class:

// Define a class
class MyClass {
  constructor(attribute1, attribute2) {
    this.attribute1 = attribute1;
    this.attribute2 = attribute2;
  }

  // Add a method
  myMethod() {
    return this.attribute1 + this.attribute2;
  }

  // Add a static method
  static staticMethod(x, y) {
    return x * y;
  }
}

// Instantiate an object of MyClass
let obj = new MyClass(10, 20);

console.log(obj.attribute1); // Output: 10
console.log(obj.myMethod()); // Output: 30
console.log(MyClass.staticMethod(3, 5)); // Output: 15

// Extend a class from another
class ChildClass extends MyClass {
  constructor(attribute1, attribute2, attribute3) {
    super(attribute1, attribute2);
    this.attribute3 = attribute3;
  }

  // Override a method
  myMethod() {
    return super.myMethod() + this.attribute3;
  }
}

let childObj = new ChildClass(10, 20, 30);
console.log(childObj.myMethod()); // Output: 60

Metaprogramming and Symbols:
In JavaScript, metaprogramming can be achieved through various techniques such as using the eval() function, creating functions dynamically, modifying object prototypes, or using features like proxies and reflection. Symbols are unique and immutable data types introduced in ECMAScript 6 that can be used as property keys.

Here's a basic example using symbols:

const mySymbol = Symbol('mySymbol');

const obj = {
    [mySymbol]: 'Hello'
};

console.log(obj[mySymbol]); // Output: Hello
Symbols can be used as unique identifiers for object properties, helping to prevent naming collisions. Metaprogramming in JavaScript can be quite powerful but should be used with caution due to its potential to introduce complexity and reduce code readability.

7. Airport
mandatory
Implement a class named Airport:

Constructor attributes:
name (String)
code (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
The default string description of the class should return the airport code (example below).

8. Primitive - Holberton Class
mandatory
Implement a class named HolbertonClass:

Constructor attributes:
size (Number)
location (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
When the class is cast into a Number, it should return the size.
When the class is cast into a String, it should return the location.

9. Hoisting
mandatory
Fix this code and make it work.

const class2019 = new HolbertonClass(2019, 'San Francisco');
const class2020 = new HolbertonClass(2020, 'San Francisco');

export class HolbertonClass {
  constructor(year, location) {
    this._year = year;
    this._location = location;
  }

  get year() {
    return this._year;
  }

  get location() {
    return this._location;
  }
}

const student1 = new StudentHolberton('Guillaume', 'Salva', class2020);
const student2 = new StudentHolberton('John', 'Doe', class2020);
const student3 = new StudentHolberton('Albert', 'Clinton', class2019);
const student4 = new StudentHolberton('Donald', 'Bush', class2019);
const student5 = new StudentHolberton('Jason', 'Sandler', class2019);

export class StudentHolberton {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
    this._holbertonClass = holbertonClass;
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
  }

  get holbertonClass() {
    return this.holbertonClass;
  }

  get fullStudentDescription() {
    return `${self._firstName} ${self._lastName} - ${self._holbertonClass.year} - ${self._holbertonClass.location}`;
